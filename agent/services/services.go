// Package services is the per-service registry: which catalogued services the product knows
// something about beyond their manifest, and what it knows.
//
// WHY A REGISTRY. A manifest describes what a service IS in terms any node can execute without
// judgement, and its schema withholds host binds so that a catalog entry cannot reach the host.
// Some services still need something the schema cannot say -- Home Assistant needs a control
// channel minted into its container, mosquitto needs a config file in front of an image that
// takes no configuration from the environment. That knowledge belongs in the PRODUCT, keyed on
// the catalog name: a curated catalog is exactly the licence to hold it, and the same call
// [V3b.29] made for readiness assessors (agent/host/readiness.go), for the same reason.
//
// THE DEFAULT IS ALWAYS NOTHING. An unknown name gets no binds, no preparation and the plain
// HTTP reach line -- precisely what every service got before any of this existed. Adding an
// entry here is how a service gets more; nothing here can take anything away.
//
// It is deliberately a switch and not a plugin system. Two entries is not a framework, the set
// is small by design, and a table keyed on strings that anyone can extend is the shape that
// turns a curated catalog into an expression language.
